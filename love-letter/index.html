                                            My love, these past eight months
                                            with you have been nothing short
                                            of magical. Time has flown by
                                            so quickly, and it's hard to
                                            believe it's already been eight
                                            months since you came into my
                                            life and made it so much
                                            brighter. They say time moves
                                            fast when you're with the ones
                                            you love, but with you, it
                                            feels like time itself has a
                                            way of disappearing
                                            altogether. Every moment with
                                            you feels like a beautiful
                                            dream, one where I don't want
                                            to wake up because I don't
                                            want to miss a single second
                                            with you. You've shown me what
                                            it's like to be truly happy
                                            and I can't thank you enough
                                            for that. These eight months
                                            have felt like just the
                                            beginning and I'm so excited
                                            to see what the rest of our
                                            lives together will bring. I
                                            think about all the milestones
                                            we'll hit, the memories we'll
                                            make, and the laughter we'll
                                            share, and it makes me so
                                            grateful to have you as my
                                            partner.

                                            Ellie, you are, without a
                                            doubt, the most beautiful and
                                            perfect girl to ever exist. I
                                            don't think I'll ever stop
                                            being in awe of you. Your
                                            beauty is the kind that takes
                                            my breath away, the kind that
                                            could stop time. I don't even
                                            know how to put it into words
                                            because it's so beyond
                                            anything I've ever seen
                                            before. When I look into your
                                            eyes, I feel like I'm being
                                            pulled into the vastness of
                                            space. They're not just
                                            beautiful‚Äîthey're mesmerizing.
                                            They're like stars, galaxies,
                                            and universes all rolled into
                                            one, and every time I get lost
                                            in them, I feel like I'm
                                            discovering something new and
                                            amazing. Your eyes are the
                                            kind of beautiful that makes
                                            me believe in magic. They hold
                                            so much depth, so much
                                            emotion, and every time they
                                            meet mine it feels like the
                                            entire world fades away
                                            leaving just us. I could get
                                            lost in your eyes forever, and
                                            I would never be bored of it.

                                            And then there's your hair, my
                                            baby, your beautifully curly,
                                            incredible hair. I know some
                                            men don't appreciate curls the
                                            way they should, but honestly,
                                            they're missing out on
                                            something truly extraordinary.
                                            Your curls are so unique, so
                                            radiant, and so undeniably
                                            you. I love everything about
                                            your hair, the way it frames
                                            your gorgeous face is just so
                                            perfectttt. Whether it's done
                                            up to perfection or just left
                                            as it naturally falls, your
                                            hair always looks amazing to
                                            me. I know there are times
                                            when you don't feel that way
                                            but let me tell you something:
                                            no matter how you see it your
                                            hair is perfect in my eyes.
                                            It's soft, vibrant, and full
                                            of character just like you. I
                                            love how it reflects your
                                            personality in so many ways,
                                            how it's a reminder of how
                                            beautifully unique you are.
                                            Your curls are a symbol of
                                            your individuality, and every
                                            time I see them, I'm reminded
                                            of just how lucky I am to have
                                            you in my life.

                                            your eyebrows are nothing
                                            short of incredible. I know it
                                            might sound like a small
                                            thing, but to me, every little
                                            detail about you is worth
                                            talking about. Your eyebrows
                                            are so beautifully shaped, and
                                            they give your face such
                                            character and personality. I
                                            notice all the little things
                                            about you, my love, and I
                                            cherish every single one of
                                            them. Your eyebrows, your

                                            of yours is perfect to me. I

                                            everything about you comes

                                            part of the many things that
                                            make you so incredible.

                                            are something I treasure more
                                            than I can even explain. The
                                            texts you send me whether it's
                                            something simple or something
                                            heartfelt always light up my
                                            entire day. I love them so
                                            much to the point where I
                                            can't even go to sleep without
                                            your good night message. It's
                                            become a part of my routine a
                                            little piece of you that I
                                            hold onto at the end of every
                                            day. When I see your message
                                            pop up on my phone my heart
                                            fills with happiness knowing
                                            that you're thinking of me.
                                            Your words are like a warm hug
                                            I don't think I'll ever stop
                                            loving how special they make
                                            me feel. Every time you send
                                            me a message, it's like I get
                                            a little reminder of how loved
                                            I am, and it's the most
                                            comforting, beautiful feeling
                                            in the world.

                                            and I wouldn't change a single
                                            thing. You are breathtaking

                                            that. Your body is a part of

                                            ever met. Your personality is

                                            where I'm meant to be.
                                            Whenever I'm with you, all my
                                            worries just melt away. You

                                            when things feel impossible.
                                            You're my home, My baby, my

                                            them when I'm lying in bed
                                            trying to fall asleep. Your

                                            love most about you, Ellie.

                                            the topic is, we always find a
                                            way to turn it into something
                                            meaningful or hilarious. I
                                            could listen to you talk
                                            forever, my love. Your voice
                                            is so soft, so soothing, so
                                            beautiful. Just hearing you
                                            talk after a stressful day is
                                            enough to make all my worries
                                            disappear. Your voice is like
                                            a melody, Ellie, one that I
                                            never want to stop hearing.
                                            It's comforting, it's calming,
                                            and it's everything I need.
                                            The way you speak, the way you
                                            express yourself, it all makes
                                            me love you even more. And our
                                            deep convos from time to time
                                            which really makes us learn
                                            about each other and deepens
                                            my love for you so much no
                                            matter how deep it is.

                                            everything I've ever dreamed
                                            of and so much more. You are

                                            everything. I never thought
                                            I'd find someone who could
                                            make me feel the way you do,
                                            but here you are, proving me
                                            wrong in the best way
                                            possible. You are my one and

                                            and I love you more than words
                                            could ever express. What we
                                            have is so special and I know
                                            I'll never find anything like
                                            it again.

                                            always been there for me.
